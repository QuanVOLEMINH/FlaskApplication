# FlaskApplication

This is an Application built on Python and Flask. 

Whenever you go to the homepage, you can login and authenticate with your GitHub account (I used OAuth2 and GitHub API). 

This app will get your profile information and release your 3 most frequently used repositories (i.e 3 repos with latest update).
